~ BWT (Burrows Weeler Transformation) encryption or decryption

~ Huffman compression or decompression

~ BWT + Huffman

***************************************************

Allows the user to encrypt and/or compress file and to decrypt and/or decrompress
file

##### INSTALLATION #####

$ cd .../desired/folder
$ git clone https://github.com/savabarde06/Algo_project.git
$ python3 main.py

##### USAGE #####

1. Open the main.py and select your desired algorithm
2. Select the file that you wish to use, file format should only be the sequence and .txt

##### SAVING FILES #####

Based on the content of the file you have and on which algorithm you selected, it
will redirect you to either COMPRESSION or DECOMPRESSION for huffman and for BWT
ENCRYTPION or DECRYTPION.

No need to put .txt when saving, it will do it automatically

##### FAQ #####

Q. My program shows that there are caracters that can't be shown when clicking on next
   with huffman, is that an issue ?

A. It has been anticipated that this kind of problem would rise, don't worry if
   you click directly on the result button and save it, there won't be any issues.
